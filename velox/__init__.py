# Welcome to Velox!

Deploying and managing live machine learning models is difficult. It involves a mix of handling model versioning, hot-swapping new versions and determining version constraint satisfaction on-the-fly, and managing binary file movement either on a networked or local file system or with a cloud storage system like S3. Velox can handle this for you with a simple base class enforcing opinionated methods of handling the above problems.

Velox provides two main utilities:

* Velox abstracts the messiness of consistent naming schemes and handling saving and loading requirements for a filesystem and for other forms of storage.
* Velox allows the ability to do a model / blob hotswap in-place for a new binary version.

## Requirements

Velox currently only supports Python 2.7, but **we would love contributions towards Python 3 support** üòÅ

The main requirements are `apscheduler` for scheduling hot-swaps, `semantic_version` for version sanity, and the `futures` Python 2.7 backport. If you want to be able to work with S3, you'll need `boto3` (and a valid and properly set up AWS account).

To run the tests, you'll need the brilliant `moto` library, the `backports.tempfile` library for Python 2.7 compatibility, and `Keras` and `sckit-learn`.

For logging, simply grab the Velox logger by the `velox` handle.

## `VeloxObject` ABC

Functionality is exposed using the `VeloxObject` abstract base class (ABC). A subclass of a `velox.obj.VeloxObject` needs to implement three things in order for the library to know how to manage it.

* Your class must be defined with a `velox.obj.register_model` decorator around it.
* Your class must implement a `_save` object method that takes as input a file object and does whatever is needed to save the object.
* Your class must implement a `_load` class method (with the `@classmethod` decorator) that takes as input a file object and reconstructs and returns an instance of your class.

Here is an example:

<!--begin_code-->
    #!python
    @register_model(
        registered_name='foobar',
        version='0.1.0-alpha',
        version_constraints='>=0.1.0,<0.2.0'
    )
    class FooBar(VeloxObject):
        def __init__(self, big_object):
            super(VeloxObject, self).__init__()
            self._big_object = big_object

        def _save(self, fileobject):
            pickle.dump(self, fileobject)

        @classmethod
        def _load(cls, fileobject):
            return pickle.load(fileobject)

        def predict(self, X):
            return self._big_object.predict(X)
<!--end_code-->
